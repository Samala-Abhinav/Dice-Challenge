# Dice-Challenge
The Dice Challenge is a fun and interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, two players are represented by two dice, and the objective is to determine which player rolls the higher number. Each time the page is refreshed, the dice are rolled randomly, and the winner is announced based on the results.
